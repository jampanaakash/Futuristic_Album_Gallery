# üöÄ Futuristic Album Gallery - Complete Manual Setup Checklist

This document provides a step-by-step checklist for setting up your futuristic photo gallery website with Firebase authentication, Google Drive image hosting, and GitHub Pages deployment.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] A Google account (for Firebase and Google Drive)
- [ ] A GitHub account
- [ ] Node.js installed on your computer
- [ ] Basic familiarity with command line/terminal
- [ ] Git installed on your computer

---

## üîê STEP 1: FIREBASE SETUP

### Create Firebase Project
- [ ] Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- [ ] Click **"Create a project"** (or select existing project)
- [ ] Enter project name (e.g., "futuristic-gallery")
- [ ] Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (optional)
- [ ] Click **"Create project"** and wait for setup to complete

### Enable Google Authentication
- [ ] In Firebase Console, navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Sign-in method**
- [ ] Find **Google** in the providers list
- [ ] Click on **Google** provider
- [ ] Toggle **Enable** switch to ON
- [ ] Enter your project's public-facing name
- [ ] Select a support email from dropdown
- [ ] Click **Save**

### Get Firebase Web Configuration
- [ ] Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí **General** tab
- [ ] Scroll down to **"Your apps"** section
- [ ] Click the **Web app** icon (`</>`)
- [ ] Enter app nickname (e.g., "gallery-web")
- [ ] **Do NOT** check "Also set up Firebase Hosting"
- [ ] Click **"Register app"**
- [ ] **COPY** the entire `firebaseConfig` object (you'll need this next)

### Update Firebase Configuration in Code
- [ ] Open your project folder
- [ ] Navigate to `src/firebase.js`
- [ ] Replace the placeholder configuration with your actual config:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key-here",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id-here"
};
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Replace ALL placeholder values with your actual Firebase config values.

---

## üìß STEP 2: EMAIL WHITELIST CONFIGURATION

### Add Authorized Email Addresses
- [ ] Open `src/firebase.js` in your code editor
- [ ] Find the `allowedEmails` array (around line 25)
- [ ] Replace the placeholder emails with actual authorized emails:

```javascript
export const allowedEmails = [
  "your-primary-email@gmail.com",
  "friend@example.com",
  "family-member@domain.com",
  "colleague@company.com"
  // Add as many emails as needed
];
```

**üìù Notes**:
- Only these emails will be able to access your gallery
- Use the exact email addresses associated with Google accounts
- You can add/remove emails anytime by updating this array

---

## üñºÔ∏è STEP 3: GOOGLE DRIVE IMAGE HOSTING SETUP

### Upload Your Photos to Google Drive
- [ ] Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
- [ ] Create folders for organization (optional):
  - "Gallery Images"
  - "Album Covers"
  - Or organize by album names
- [ ] Upload all images you want in your gallery
- [ ] Ensure images are good quality (recommended: 1200px+ width)

### Make Each Image Publicly Accessible
**For EVERY image you want to use:**

- [ ] Right-click on the image in Google Drive
- [ ] Select **"Share"**
- [ ] Click **"Change to anyone with the link"**
- [ ] Ensure permission is set to **"Viewer"**
- [ ] Click **"Copy link"**
- [ ] Save this link temporarily (you'll convert it next)

### Convert Google Drive Links to Direct Links
**For each copied link, convert the format:**

**Original format:**
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123XYZ456DEF/view?usp=sharing
```

**Convert to direct format:**
```
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ABC123XYZ456DEF
```

**Steps:**
1. Copy the FILE_ID (the long string between `/d/` and `/view`)
2. Use this format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`
3. Test the direct link in a browser - you should see the image directly

**üí° Pro Tip**: Create a spreadsheet to track your images and their converted links.

## üìÇ STEP 4: CREATE YOUR ALBUMS DATA

### Edit the Albums Configuration File
- [ ] Open `public/albums.json` in your code editor
- [ ] Replace the sample data with your actual albums
- [ ] Use this structure for each album:

```json
{
  "albums": [
    {
      "id": "unique-album-id-1",
      "title": "Your Album Title",
      "cover": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=COVER_IMAGE_ID",
      "images": [
        "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=IMAGE_1_ID",
        "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=IMAGE_2_ID",
        "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=IMAGE_3_ID"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "unique-album-id-2",
      "title": "Another Album",
      "cover": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=ANOTHER_COVER_ID",
      "images": [
        "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=MORE_IMAGE_IDS"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**üìù Album Guidelines:**
- `id`: Use lowercase, hyphenated names (e.g., "family-vacation-2024")
- `title`: Display name for the album
- `cover`: First image shown in the graph node
- `images`: Array of all images in the album (including cover if desired)

### Example Real Album Entry
```json
{
  "id": "bali-vacation-2024",
  "title": "Bali Vacation 2024",
  "cover": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ABC123XYZ456",
  "images": [
    "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ABC123XYZ456",
    "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DEF789GHI012",
    "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1JKL345MNO678"
  ]
}
```
